// glibc's posix_spawn, from a parent of four threads (fixtures/programs/
// spawn-threads.c, dynamically linked). glibc clones with
// clone3(CLONE_VM | CLONE_VFORK) onto a stack of its own; the page runs the
// child in the calling thread's Worker until its exec (hosts/browser/src/
// vfork.rs). Every child (24 spawns and a missing program) must have run in
// place rather than as a copied fork, and their programs start on runtimes
// their Workers made in the host's pool (`preattach`): at least one does,
// and none fails to be made or is dropped as not fitting -- under the mem64
// seed every one failed ("cannot import i32 memory as i64") and each spawn
// quietly paid for a new one.
