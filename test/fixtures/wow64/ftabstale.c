/* A thread that runs on across another thread's unit install
 * (test/wow64/ftabstale). Unit code calls a function pointer
 * through the process-wide probe cache straight into its own Worker's
 * function table, so a thread that last caught up before the install calls
 * an index past its table's end. The worker thread makes its last system
 * call (SetEvent), then spins on a flag in this exe's own unit code. The
 * main thread loads ftabdll.dll (whose unit the test built), gets its unit
 * installed, and calls ftab_sum through a pointer, which publishes the
 * entry's index. Then it sets the flag, and the worker calls through the
 * same pointer, with no system call between. Prints "ftabdll at BASE", then
 * "ftabstale ok S". */
