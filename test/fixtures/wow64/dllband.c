/* test/wow64/dllband: the DLLs a WoW64 prefix pins load in the band.
 *
 * The test writes the prefix's dll-bases with wine/dll-bases.py
 * (--i386) for the DLLs below, and this loads them: each must be at the
 * address the file gives it, in [0x11000000, 0x20000000), where gex's compact
 * space keeps an island for them (docs/wine-native.md §3.19), not at its own
 * base (wine32-bases.txt, 0x20000000 and up), where the browser shim's heap may
 * already be. One of them is a program's own DLL in a directory whose name
 * has a space (C:\pin dir\pinme.dll): its pin names a unix path with a
 * space in it. Prints "dllband ok". */
