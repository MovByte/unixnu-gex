/**
 * Do a Worker's fetch notes reach its host only, and in order?
 *
 * fetch-note.mjs says what a Worker fetches and installs. A process's Worker
 * hands it to its host (`setNoteSink`, worker.mjs) and never opens the
 * 'gex-fetch' channel, since every open channel is handed every other one's
 * messages; a realm with no host (a page's own Worker) still says it on the
 * channel. This runs both in worker threads, counting the channels each
 * opens:
 *
 *   - with a sink: every note in the sink, a fetch's start before its end,
 *     no channel opened, nothing on the channel;
 *   - without: the same notes on the channel, in order, one channel opened.
 *
 * Usage: node test/fixtures/page/fetch-note.mjs
