/**
 * Does an append to the module store give up when the engine will not grow it?
 *
 * The store is a growable SharedArrayBuffer; `grow` throws a RangeError both
 * when a sibling Worker grew it past the request (retried) and when the
 * engine is out of memory. The second used to be retried for good: the Worker
 * spun in `storeAppend`, and every Worker of its process with it. Here the
 * store's `grow` always throws: the append must return -1 (the registry then
 * keeps the bytes itself), and promptly. A grow that a sibling won must still
 * succeed.
 *
 * Usage: node test/fixtures/page/module-store-oom.mjs   (run under `timeout`: a hang fails)
