/* More threads alive at once in one process than a Worker's shim once had
 * stacks for (64: "no shim stack slot left for this Worker"). A round
 * starts its threads and parks every one before any is released, so all
 * are live together; then they are released and joined, and each returns
 * its own number. First 100, which must all start. Then 300, past what the
 * page runs at once (256 Workers a process): there pthread_create must say
 * EAGAIN, and every thread it did start must run and be joined; natively
 * all 300 start. How many started goes to stderr, so the output is the same
 * either way. With the argument "first" (a host that cannot run 300
 * threads), the first round only. With "capped" (test/x86-programs runs it in a
 * scope with a small task limit), 50 and then 300: the host's own limit
 * must come back as EAGAIN, with every thread that started run and
 * joined. Prints "threads-many ok". */
