/* Signal masks and thread-directed signals are per thread. Mono's GC stops
 * the world by pthread_kill(SIGPWR)-ing each thread and waiting for each
 * handler to post a semaphore, while Unity's own worker threads run with
 * every signal blocked. gex kept one mask and one pending set per process
 * and raised a tgkill on the *caller*, so the GC waited forever.
 *
 * A thread with all signals blocked must not stop another thread from taking
 * a signal; a signal sent to a thread runs its handler on that thread, even
 * one blocked in a condition-variable wait; and the blocked thread still has
 * the signal pending when it unblocks. */
