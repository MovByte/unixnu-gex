/* A forked child runs code its parent translated, on several pages.
 *
 * The child's page table keeps its parent's page numbering, and its dispatch
 * directory is rebuilt without the parent's runtime entries. Its first
 * translation, on fork's return path, runs on into the next pages, which are
 * numbered but have no entry. Those blocks failed their page check, and
 * `heal_dirs` wrote the entries and said "gex: heal" (a bug line). test/x86-programs fails
 * this test, in the page, on any heal line. */
