/* A syscall that parks while another process runs.
 *
 * The browser host has one wasm stack and one address space, so a process that
 * blocks is written out to a snapshot and another is written in. When the
 * first one is put back, the syscall it parked in still owes it a return
 * value, and only the scheduler can supply it.
 *
 * It did not always get the chance. `install_process` primed the resume point
 * when it swapped a process in, on the reasoning that the scheduler runs next
 * and overwrites it. It does -- unless it finds nothing ready and gives the
 * stack back to the page, which does not overwrite anything. The page then
 * read that primed value and re-entered the guest at the instruction after its
 * `svc`, with no return value ever written.
 *
 * What that looks like from in here is a syscall returning its own first
 * argument. `epoll_wait` came back with 5, which was the epoll descriptor
 * still sitting in x0, and the caller walked five events off the end of an
 * array that had none in it. In an X server the same thing landed as a
 * link register full of rubbish and a branch into unmapped memory.
 *
 * So: park in a syscall that can only be finished by the host, make sure
 * another process runs while it is parked, and check what the syscall
 * returned. A timeout is the wake rather than a descriptor becoming ready,
 * because that is the path that goes out to the page and back.
