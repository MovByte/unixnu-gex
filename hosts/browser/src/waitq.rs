//! Waiting, the Linux way.
//!
//! A Worker runs one guest thread, and the thread owns one *wait slot*: a
//! word in the global kernel's memory (`k_ws_*`), found from the Worker's
//! kernel stack. When the thread blocks, this registers the slot on the wait
//! queue of every object the thread waits for -- the pipe, the socket, each
//! descriptor of a `poll`, the epoll set (whose queue is chained onto its
//! descriptors'), the futex's bucket -- and on its process's queue, which a
//! signal, a child's exit or the process ending notifies. Then it checks
//! readiness, and parks on the slot until a notify or its own deadline. A
//! write to a pipe wakes the threads registered on that pipe and nobody
//! else: there is no global wake word any more, and no syscall wakes every
//! parked Worker of every process.
//!
//! The scheduler's idle turn asks only its own thread, from the snapshot
//! taken when the wait began ([`MyWait`]), with no lock: finishing the
//! syscall once the wait is over and delivering a signal that arrived are
//! the free path's (`sigs::finish`), and the page's only lock left, the exec
//! lock (`ExecLock`), is the process calls' alone.
