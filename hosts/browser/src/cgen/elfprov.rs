//! ELF export providers in the browser (the native
//! host is hosts/native/src/elfprov.rs): a library a provider names
//! (`/* PROVIDES libc.so.6 x86_64`) gets its exports bound in the function
//! table when it maps, by `gex_cgen::provider::elf_bindings`, before the
//! guest goes on.
//!
//! Each library's providers become a provider-only unit (no unit module of
//! its own) that JS serves as it serves an image's providers: it loads the
//! module from the unit cache (`providers/<name>-<fingerprint>.wasm`, built
//! natively) and calls `gex_cgen_provider_publish`. So this needs the unit
//! cache (`--cgen-prefer` under run-node, `cgen=` on a page).
//!
//! A forked child is a fresh shim whose table starts empty, while the GOT it
//! inherited holds resolver+1 addresses that only the bindings make code:
//! before the child runs, JS asks (`gex_elfprov_wanted`), and the libraries
//! its kernel says are mapped are bound again. Bound addresses are not code
//! for the function JIT ([`provided`]). As natively, the bindings outlive an
//! unmapping; another object mapped over them takes them back.
