//! A `posix_spawn` child in its parent's Worker.
//!
//! glibc's and musl's `posix_spawn` clone with `CLONE_VM | CLONE_VFORK`: the
//! child shares the parent's memory and runs on a stack the parent set
//! aside, and the calling thread is suspended until the child execs or
//! exits; the parent's other threads run on. The child only applies its
//! file actions and attributes and execs (or, when the exec fails, writes
//! the error to a pipe and exits). Under gex every other child gets a Worker
//! of its own with a copy of the parent's image; this one needs neither the
//! copy nor the Worker until its exec, and the exec needs none of the
//! parent's image.
//!
//! So the child runs in the calling thread's Worker, in the parent's memory
//! as Linux runs it (nothing of the memory is saved or put back: what the
//! child writes, the parent sees, as with `CLONE_VM`). A wasm32 program's
//! child runs nested inside the parent's `clone` (`#vforkChild` in
//! gex.mjs); a translated program's runs in the Worker's run loop in place
//! of the parent's thread (`#vforkEnter`), which resumes after it:
//!
//!   1. `gex_vfork_begin` claims the fork and gives this Worker the child's
//!      process: a `Host` built as a forked child's Worker builds one
//!      (`child_host`: its pid, descriptors, working directory, signal
//!      state, one thread), with the parent's memory map and translation
//!      state (the process's one `JIT`). `with_exec_lock` serves this Worker that host
//!      while the child runs; what is read without the kernel (the pid, the
//!      exit flag, the descriptor table, the signal state) is this Worker's
//!      too. The parent's process stays in place for its other Workers.
//!      The calling thread's register context, which the child's start and
//!      calls write, is kept aside;
//!   2. the child's calls go to its own kernel, except those that would
//!      change the memory map the parent shares (`check`): those end it as
//!      a crash, which `posix_spawn`'s child never makes;
//!   3. the child ends: it exits (published as any exit), or it execs
//!      (`stage_exec`: its command, descriptors, signal state and working
//!      directory, which JS hands to a new Worker), or it crashes;
//!   4. `gex_vfork_end` gives the Worker back to the parent's thread, with
//!      its register context, and the parent's `clone` returns the child's
//!      pid.
//!
//! A plain `fork` (and `vfork()`, which is `fork`) keeps the copy and the
//! Worker of its own: its child runs the parent's code on the parent's stack
//! and may do anything.
//!
//! A vfork child may itself spawn so (Qt's `startDetached`: its child's
//! `vforkfd`; glibc's `posix_spawn` from a child), and that grandchild runs
//! here too, nested: the child's state is kept aside as the parent's thread
//! is ([`STACK`]), and comes back when the grandchild is done. So the
//! grandchild writes the memory its parent reads, as glibc's `posix_spawn`
//! has its child report a failed exec (`args->err`), where a copy of the
//! memory would lose it.
