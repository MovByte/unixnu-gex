//! A Wayland compositor for the guest in a browser: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-0`.
//!
//! [`gex_wayland`] is the protocol as a state machine; this joins it to a guest
//! and to the page. It binds a name in the unix-socket namespace (see
//! `mount_devices`), pumps bytes between each client and its compositor state
//! once per scheduler turn (the one place every thread passes through on its
//! way to waiting -- so a client's blocked wait always has a serviced reply),
//! and hands each committed frame's pixels to the page to blit onto the canvas.
//!
//! This mirrors `hosts/native/src/wayland.rs`, minus the GPU compositor and the
//! PPM file output: the browser has one surface (the canvas) and composites
//! there. Shared memory only, like the protocol -- a client that insists on a
//! GPU buffer (`linux-dmabuf`/`wl_drm`) finds none and falls back to `wl_shm`.
