//! corruption: a Worker's first call running on wasm-ld's default stack wrote
//! into a game's .text for months. Every region is registered here with
//! its owner as it is created -- the fixed layout once, then each heap span,
//! each Worker's stack and thread-local block, each arena span the guest's
//! mappings take, the Windows address space at NT boot -- and a region that
//! overlaps another owner's stops the run, naming both. Guest regions may
//! overlap each other (the guest remaps its own memory); nothing else may
//! overlap anything.
//!
//! No allocation anywhere here: the heap's refill path registers its spans.
