# Build the browser shim.
#
# The shim shares the guest's memory rather than having one of its own, which
# is what makes a syscall a direct read of the guest's buffers. Three linker
# flags arrange it:
#
#   --import-memory     take the memory from the host instead of defining one
#   --global-base       put this module's data above the guest's world, which
#                       ends at STACK_TOP (0x8000_0000); the guest never maps
#                       above it, so nothing collides
#   -z stack-size       how much of the region the shim's stack gets
#
# The stack is the awkward one: wasm-ld places it from address zero whatever
# --global-base says, which lands it on the guest's image. So __stack_pointer
# is exported and JS moves it into this module's region before the first call
# (see gex.mjs). Nothing has run at that point -- there is no start function --
# so there is nothing on the old stack to lose.
#
# --initial-memory must match what the guest module declares, or the import
# will not link.

# GEX_HEAP_COUNTERS=1 builds a shim that tracks how much of its heap is out on
# loan, and reports it through `gex_heap_used_kib` -- which the glue folds into
# the message on an unexpected trap.
#
# Worth having because the heap is a *fixed* region: `--global-base` puts it
# above the guest's world and it runs to the top of a memory that cannot grow,
# so there is a real ceiling (`gex_heap_total_kib`, about 2039 MiB) and no
# symptom when a lift hits it. Recompiling Mesa's software rasteriser is the
# case -- 471,205 blocks, a peak working set of 2109 MiB measured natively --
# and telling that apart from a wild pointer needs a number.
#
# Not the default because counting charges every allocation and free, and the
# runtime translator allocates constantly.
