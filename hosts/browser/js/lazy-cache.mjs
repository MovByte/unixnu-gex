// Lazy files kept in the page's Cache Storage (app.js `lazyCache`). A lazy
// file's read happens in a Worker blocked in the kernel (lazy-fetch.mjs),
// which cannot wait on a promise; the cache is asynchronous. So the read is
// asked of one Worker that owns the cache (page/src/lazy-cache-worker.js)
// through slots in a SharedArrayBuffer: the reader fills a slot, wakes the
// owner and waits; the owner answers from the cache, or fetches what the
// cache lacks (a ranged request, as the reader would have made) and keeps
// it, and writes the bytes straight into the kernel's memory, where the
// reader wanted them. Kept by chunk (CHUNK, the kernel's LAZY_CHUNK), under
// the file's URL, its version and the chunk's number (chunkKey), so a later
// visit, after any rebuild, has every chunk any visit read of the same
// bytes. An eject site's lazy file URL is its bytes' hash (eject-site.mjs);
// other lists name files by path, and the version -- the list's size and
// mtime -- is what tells a file changed under the same URL from the one
// kept.
//
// The slots: `ctl`, an Int32Array on a SharedArrayBuffer of SLOTS * SLOT
// bytes after a header of HEAD bytes. ctl[0] counts requests (the owner
// waits on it). A slot, i32 at SLOT/4 * i + HEAD/4:
//   [0] state: FREE, ASKED (the reader waits), TAKEN (the owner reads the
//       cache or fetches; the reader keeps waiting), WRITING (the owner
//       copies), DONE, GIVEN_UP (no owner took the ask in time and the
//       reader went to the network itself: the owner must not write)
//   [1] result: bytes written, or -1
//   [2] dst, [3] len, [4] url length, [5..6] offset (f64 at byte 24)
//   bytes 32..: the URL (a path on the page's origin), at most URL_MAX
