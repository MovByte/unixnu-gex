//! The compositor for a host-side X server.
//!
//! When Xwayland is a guest program, its compositor is the one in that
//! process's shim ([`gex_browser::wl`]) and its window manager talks to it over
//! a guest unix socket. When Xwayland is a *host* module -- `Xwayland.wasm`,
//! built by `ports/xwayland/build.sh` -- neither of those places exists, so
//! this module is the other end of both of its connections:
//!
//!   * the Wayland connection, which is [`gex_wayland::Client`] fed the bytes
//!     the server writes, with its events handed straight back. No socket: the
//!     server is a module in the same Worker, and its "socket" is a queue.
//!
//!   * the X connection the window manager needs, which is [`gex_xwm`] over a
//!     queue of the same kind. Xwayland is started with `-wm <fd>`, so the
//!     manager is a client it was handed rather than one that connected.
//!
//! What crosses to the page is what crosses for a guest: fixed-size scene
//! records saying where each surface's pixels are, and input events coming
//! back. The pixels themselves are in the X server's own memory, which the
//! page's compositor Worker reads directly -- so an X window reaches the screen
//! with no copy, the same as a guest's `wl_shm` buffer.
