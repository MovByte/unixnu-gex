//! Wait slots and wait queues.
//!
//! A *slot* is one waiting thread: a word here, in the memory every Worker
//! shares, that its Worker parks on (`k_ws_park`) and a waker bumps and
//! notifies. Each Worker runs one guest thread, so a Worker owns one slot for
//! as long as it lives.
//!
//! A *queue* is one waitable object's list of waiters: a bitmap of slots,
//! plus the queues chained to it (an epoll set watching the object). A waiter
//! sets its bit on every object it waits for, checks readiness, parks on its
//! slot, and clears the bits when the wait is over; whoever changes the
//! object's readiness notifies its queue, which wakes the slots whose bits
//! are set and nothing else.
//!
//! Lock-free on both sides: registration is a `fetch_or`, a notify reads the
//! bitmap and bumps the slots in it. A waiter samples its slot's value
//! *before* it registers and checks, and parks only while the slot still
//! reads that value -- so a notify between its check and its park is not
//! lost. (wasm's atomics are sequentially consistent, which is what makes the
//! register-then-check against change-then-notify order sound.)
//!
//! The page reaches the same structures from JavaScript (`wl-bridge.mjs`
//! wakes a process's compositor connection this way), so the layout is
//! fixed and simple: see `Queue` and `k_wq_dir`.
