// import leaves the module's own memory at 0 where all its code expects it.

// The entry to append: kind 0x02 (memory), limits flag 0x03 -- a maximum, and

//
// Shared, because the process memory *is* shared: it is one guest process's
// address space and every thread of that process is a Worker running on it.
// Only the sharing is narrower than the kernel's, which spans every process.
// So there is no "shared one and plain one" here; there are two shared
// memories with different scopes.
//
// That matters concretely rather than nominally: a memory import's `shared`
// flag is part of its *type*, and so are its minimum and maximum. A module
// that declares a plain memory will not accept a `SharedArrayBuffer` however
// large it is, and one that declares the wrong bounds will not link at all.
// Both numbers are the guest's fixed address space.
//
// `shared` is an argument for exactly that reason. A process whose threads
// are Workers has a shared memory and needs flag 0x03; a process that is a
// single Worker has a plain one and needs 0x01, and a module built for the
// first will not instantiate against the second. So the kernel module is
// emitted twice, once for each, and a host picks by what its processes are.
