// A desktop whose windows are elements.
//
// The other compositor (`compositor-worker.js`) draws the whole scene itself,
// in one WebGPU scene, on one canvas: titlebars, borders, stacking, cursor
// and all. This one draws none of that. Each window is a `<canvas>` handed to
// the page, and everything around it -- the frame, the title, where it sits,
// what happens when it is dragged -- is the page's HTML. Same compositor
// underneath: the same arena of surface descriptors, the same input ring, the
// same protocol running in each guest process.
//
// What that buys is everything the DOM already does. Decorations are CSS and
// can be anything; a window can be animated, transformed, put in a flexbox or
// a grid; the browser composites, so an idle window costs nothing where the
// WebGPU scene redraws all of it every frame; and hit-testing is the browser's
// -- a `pointerdown` on a window's canvas arrives with `offsetX`/`offsetY`,
// which is surface-local coordinates, exactly, including under a transform.
//
// # Geometry
//
// Both directions, and they are not symmetrical.
//
// The page tells the compositor where it put a window (`place`). A Wayland
// toplevel does not care -- there is no position in that protocol and a client
// never learns one -- but an X client's window has real coordinates, and its
// menus, tooltips and drag-and-drop all read them, so the window manager has
// to be told or they land in the wrong place.
//
// The compositor tells the page where a window *wants* to be (`onplace`). A
// popup carries an `xdg_positioner`, an X override-redirect window carries
// coordinates its client chose, and a subsurface is placed relative to its
// parent. Those are the client's decision, not the page's.
//
// # Pixels
//
// A surface is an address in a `SharedArrayBuffer`, which is the same thing
// the WebGPU compositor uploads with `queue.writeTexture`. Here it goes into a 2D
// canvas, which costs a copy and a swizzle: shm is BGRA and `ImageData` is
// RGBA, and `ImageData` refuses a shared buffer besides. Damage-bounded, so a
// terminal's cursor blink copies a few hundred bytes.
//
// A window whose pixels are the host's OpenGL (see `F_EXTERNAL`) has no
// address to copy from: its frames are a texture in the renderer that runs
// the guest's GL. Such a window gets a WebGPU canvas of its own, laid over its
// 2D one, and the renderer presents into it -- see `#drawGl` below.
