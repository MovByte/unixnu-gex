// The page with no compositor: a program's windows drawn straight into the
// page, one canvas each, laid out by the browser.
//
// gex-eject's `"compositor": false` (crates/gex-eject/README.md). The scene
// compositor (`compositor-worker.js`) draws every surface into one WebGPU
// canvas, with a frame and a title bar around each toplevel, a cursor sprite
// and its own hit testing. A program that draws its own frames -- Wine does,
// a Windows window's caption and border are the window's -- needs none of
// that: this puts each surface's `DomDesktop` canvas in a positioned element
// and lets the browser composite them. No WebGPU device, no worker, no scene,
// no decorations; the popups (menus, the Ribbon's drop-downs, tooltips) sit
// above their parents where the client placed them.
//
// It is a `DomDesktop` underneath (dom-compositor.js): the same surface arena,
// input ring and protocol in each guest process. What this file adds is the
// layout a page would otherwise do, and the `describe()` a harness reads from
// the scene compositor (titles, the surface list, a content hash).
