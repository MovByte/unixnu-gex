//! Signals without the kernel lock.
//!
//! A process's signal state is two kinds of shared object
//! ([`gex_kernel::signal`]): the process's `ProcSig` (dispositions, the
//! process-directed pending word, the interval timers) and each thread's
//! `ThreadSig` (its own pending word and mask). Both are reference-counted
//! and synchronise themselves, so a Worker asks whether its own thread has a
//! signal to take, and builds the handler frame for it, without the kernel:
//! what a safepoint does a thousand back edges at a time.
