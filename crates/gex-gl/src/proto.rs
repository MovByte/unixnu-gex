//! The command stream between a guest's GL driver and the host's.
//!
//! The split is at the API, not at a virtual GPU. A virtio-gpu driver would run
//! Mesa's state tracker as translated aarch64 (tens of thousands of
//! instructions per draw) and compile each shader twice. Instead the guest's
//! `libGLESv2.so.2` is a pure marshaller: a call becomes a few dozen bytes
//! appended to a buffer, and the host's native driver runs them. This is what
//! Android's emulator does.
//!
//! The buffer is guest memory the host already has mapped, so a call is a memcpy
//! with no syscall or host call out of wasm (the expensive thing). One kick per
//! flush hands over the whole batch, forced early only when a call needs an
//! answer. Names are guest-allocated: GL accepts an unseen name, and for shaders
//! and programs, where it will not, the host keeps a guest-to-host map.
