                  the CPU, with a note, when there is no adapter
  --recompile-objects
                  statically recompile each shared library as it is mapped,
                  rather than translating it a dispatch miss at a time. Off by
                  default: measured slower, because seeding from every
                  decodable address translates far more of a library than any
                  one program uses. Measured on Debian bash and glibc, with
                  compilation parallel and the element-segment limit fixed:
                  cold 14s against the runtime translator's 8s, and 4s
                  against 1s once both are cached. What it buys is the
                  absence of translation pauses part way through a run, not
                  speed -- an X server that dlopens a 24 MB driver mid-frame
                  is the case that wants it.
  --profile       reuse the previous run's discovered entry points. Off by
                  default: it changes the translation and so the cache key,
                  which costs a whole recompilation on the second run of a
                  program -- measured at five to six seconds on bash and
                  busybox, for no measurable gain once both settle
  --exhaustive    translate every decodable text address ahead of time
  --exhaustive-for NAME[,NAME]
                  do that for these objects of a closure only. libc is what
                  every program shares, and a closure built for one program
                  holds only the libc paths that program walks
  --no-jit        no runtime translation; implies --exhaustive
  --cgen          the function tier: compile the program's blocks as C with
                  clang (needs clang and wasm-ld)
  --fjit          the function JIT: every function recovered at run time
                  from guest memory, a batch at a time, as wasm emitted
                  directly and installed in the function table;
                  tier-1 runs what it does not
  --fjit-image    the function JIT ahead of time: the program image's
                  recovered functions spliced into its tier-1 module, as
                  --cgen does with clang
  --lazy          discover only from the entry point, leaving the rest to
                  runtime translation; much faster to start on a big binary
  --no-cache      do not reuse compiled modules between runs
  --record DIR    write an execution profile (DIR/profile.json) and a
                  session manifest (DIR/session.json) at exit: exact block
                  and call counts, top-4 indirect targets, unexpected
                  returns, interior entries, syscalls per function, the
