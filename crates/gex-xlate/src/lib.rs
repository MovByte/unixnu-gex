//! `gex-xlate` — the translator facade.
//!
//! Ties the decoder, lifter and backend together and drives *code discovery*.
//!
//! Discovery is a best-effort search, never a correctness requirement:
//! everything it misses ends up in an untranslated dispatch slot
//! and is reported precisely at run time instead of silently misexecuting.
//! The more it finds ahead of time, the less work is left for the runtime
//! translator.
//!
//! Four sources feed the work list:
//!
//! 1. the ELF entry point;
//! 2. `STT_FUNC` symbols that land in an executable segment;
//! 3. direct branch and call targets, followed recursively;
//! 4. every naturally-aligned doubleword anywhere in the image whose value
//!    points into executable memory — which is how function-pointer tables,
//!    `.init_array`, the GOT and C++ vtables get covered.
