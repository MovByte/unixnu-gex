//! Whole-program call-graph summaries ([`Summary`]).
//!
//! Each function is analysed by abstract interpretation over its memory-form
//! CFG, with its callees' summaries standing in for the calls, and the
//! results are iterated to a fixpoint over the call graph's strongly
//! connected components, callees first. The rule: **summaries over-approximate and never guess.**
//! Anything unknown (an unresolved indirect jump, an indirect call, a callee
//! that was not recovered, a syscall that is not on the known-harmless list)
//! makes the affected parts of the summary "everything".
//!
//! # The abstract domain
//!
//! A value is a constant, an *entry value plus an offset* (`x19` as it was
//! on entry, `sp` on entry minus 48), the return address (x86-64: the word
//! at the entry stack pointer), or unknown. Every value also carries the set
//! of entry registers it was computed from by arithmetic (its *taint*), which
//! is how [`Summary::addr_inputs`] and frame escape are tracked. Stack slots
//! at constant offsets from the entry stack pointer hold abstract values, so
//! a register saved in the prologue and restored in the epilogue is seen to
//! come back unchanged: that is how `preserved` is proved.
//!
//! A slot is only trusted while nothing could have written it: a store to
//! an address the analysis cannot place kills the slots of the caller's
//! frame always, and this function's own slots only once the frame has
//! *escaped* (a frame address was stored to memory, passed to a callee that
//! uses that register as an address or may store it
//! ([`Summary::escaping_inputs`]), or handed to a syscall). A callee's
//! writes above its entry stack pointer ([`Summary::caller_frame_writes`])
//! kill exactly the slots they cover. Nothing is kept below the stack
//! pointer less the red zone (x86-64's 128 bytes; none on AArch64), where a
//! signal frame may land at any time, nor below the stack pointer at a call
//! (the callee's frame). A reload narrower than 8 bytes gives the stored
//! value's low bytes, extended, never the entry value itself.
//!
//! Where values go is tracked as well: every entry register a value was
//! computed from is in its taint, so a value that reaches memory other code
//! can read (anything but this function's own unescaped frame), the kernel
//! (for the few syscalls that keep a pointer, or any syscall not known to
//! be harmless) or unknown code makes its taint [`Summary::escaping_inputs`],
//! and what reaches an output register at a return makes
//! [`Summary::output_sources`]. A caller uses both: a frame address in an
//! escaping input lets its frame escape, and a callee's outputs are tainted
//! by the caller's values in its output sources only.
//!
//! # Fixpoint
//!
//! Members of a recursive SCC start at [`Summary::bottom`] (the optimistic
//! value: nothing read, everything preserved, never returns) and are
//! recomputed until nothing changes, which gives the sound result by the
//! usual induction on call depth for the "must" parts (`preserved`,
//! `sp_delta`) and least-fixpoint reasoning for the "may" parts. A component
//! that has not converged after [`MAX_ITERATIONS`] is set to
//! [`Summary::unknown`].
