//! Reaching the calling process's memory from the global kernel module.
//!
//! The kernel is one module with one memory, shared by every Worker of every
//! process. A guest's buffers are not in it: they live in that process's own
//! memory, imported as a second memory that an ordinary pointer cannot address.
//!
//! `memory.copy` can name two memories and is the whole interface. Rust has no
//! syntax for it (a `*mut u8` is always address space 0), so the copies here are
//! inline assembly. A scalar load or store against memory 1 is *not* possible --
//! the assembler cannot put a memory index in a memarg -- so a syscall reading a
//! word copies eight bytes into its own memory first. Real cost on small reads,
//! none on the buffers that matter.
