//! Assembling translated blocks into a loadable wasm module.
//!
//! The module's shape is fixed by the runtime ABI in `gex-abi`:
//!
//! * one linear memory that *is* the guest address space;
//! * one funcref table indexed by `(pc - text_base) >> 2`, every slot filled
//!   — translated blocks where we have them, a miss stub everywhere else, so
//!   a branch to an untranslated address produces a precise diagnostic
//!   instead of an "uninitialized element" trap;
//! * an `enter(ctx, pc)` export the host calls to start execution.
