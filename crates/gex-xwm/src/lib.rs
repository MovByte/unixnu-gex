//! redirected the window with the Composite extension -- so a compositor that
//! wants X clients has to be their window manager too. This is that manager,
//! spoken directly over the X11 wire protocol: no Xlib, no xcb, no second
//! process. It is a crate rather than part of a shim because there are two
//! places it has to run from -- a guest process's shim, when Xwayland is a
//! guest program, and the page's Worker, when Xwayland is a wasm module beside
//! the compositor.
