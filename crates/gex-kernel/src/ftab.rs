//! The function table's host half, shared by both
//! shims: which guest address has which [`gex_abi::ftab`] index, process-wide.
//!
//! A table belongs to one store natively and one Worker in the browser, so
//! every thread has its own, numbered alike. What is the same everywhere
//! lives here:
//!
//! * **indices**, allocated in ranges (a module fills a range from its
//!   `__table_base`), never reused: a retired index keeps meaning "re-resolve"
//!   for as long as anything may still hold it;
//! * **the address map**, authoritative: guest address → index;
//! * **the log** every table replays from its own watermark, so a thread
//!   that has not caught up yet finds out what to fill and what to point
//!   back at the resolve stub ([`Event`]);
//! * **the probe cache** in guest memory (`gex_abi::FCACHE`), written on a
//!   lookup and cleared on retirement.
//!
//! What a table *holds* is the host's: a store's `wasmtime::Table`, a
//! Worker's `WebAssembly.Table`. A slot nobody has filled holds the resolve
//! stub, so a thread behind the log is never wrong, only slower.
