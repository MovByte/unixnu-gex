//! OSS audio devices, `/dev/dsp` and `/dev/mixer`: a null output for now.
//!
//! Wine's audio is mmdevapi over
//! wineoss.drv, the OSSv4 driver, and this is the device it talks to: one
//! playback engine that takes 16-, 24- and 32-bit and float PCM at any rate,
//! and plays it into nothing at the rate it was set to. Its buffer drains
//! with the wall clock, so a program that paces itself by the device (as
//! mmdevapi's clients do, by the padding it reports) runs at the right
//! speed. No capture. A device that plays (the browser's WebAudio, the
//! host's) replaces the drain, not the interface: while a player is taking
//! this stream's frames ([`set_audio_pending`]), what is queued is what it
//! has not played yet, so writers pace to the player's clock (the audio
//! hardware's) and the two clocks never drift apart.
//!
//! The requests are Linux's OSSv4 numbers (`_IOR`/`_IOWR` of Linux's
//! `sys/ioctl.h`), and the structs `oss_sysinfo` (1248 bytes),
//! `oss_audioinfo` (1180) and `audio_buf_info` (16) are laid out as OSSv4's
//! `sys/soundcard.h` has them: ints and char arrays only, the same on every
//! ABI gex runs.
