//! Atomic operations on one word of guest memory.
//!
//! Guest memory is shared with guest threads that run wasm atomics on it
//! (glibc's mutex fast paths are a `lock cmpxchg` in guest code), so a kernel
//! operation that must update a word *against* them (a priority-inheritance
//! futex: `FUTEX_LOCK_PI` sets the waiters bit on a word the owner may be
//! releasing in user space at the same moment) needs a real atomic, not a
//! read and a write. gex-kernel forbids unsafe code; this crate is the one
//! place that views a guest word as an atomic, and the guest memory itself
//! as a pointer and a length ([`mem::Span`]).
//!
//! Every function takes the guest memory as the kernel sees it (a byte
//! slice) and an offset, and fails (`None`) for an offset that is out of
//! range or not 4-aligned, as the futex syscalls require.
