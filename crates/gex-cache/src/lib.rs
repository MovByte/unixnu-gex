//! A content-addressed cache of compiled modules.
//!
//! Compiling translated wasm to machine code is the slow part of startup
//! (Cranelift takes ~30s on a large program) and is identical on every run of
//! the same binary, so it is cached. The key hashes the guest image, the
//! translation options, and a format version. It need not cover the engine's
//! configuration: [`wasmtime::Module::deserialize`] checks that itself.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Deserialising a compiled module is unsafe: the bytes become executable code
//! behind only a header check. gex trusts them because they live in a
//! per-user-writable cache directory — anyone who can write there can already
//! replace the binary that reads it. The `unsafe` lives here so the host can
//! forbid it.
