# gexcc runtime: the safepoint countdown GexPoll's loop polls decrement
# (poll/GexPoll.cpp). A module global, so each thread (instance) has its
# own. It starts at 0: a thread's first loop polls once and re-arms it.
# Hidden: with shared libraries (GEXCC_SHARED) every module links its own
# copy, as a wasm global cannot be imported through a .so's symbols.
