/* libgex (wasm64, 64-bit Wine): running the signal frames gex-kernel leaves at a
 * syscall's return, for a program built LP64 and lowered to wasm32. The
 * wasm32 form is ../libgex/signal.c.
 *
 * musl's wasm64 syscall stub calls this when the context's PC changed across
 * the syscall. The frame is x86-64's: RSP points at it (its first word is
 * the return address a handler would return to), RDI is the signal,
 * RSI = &info, RDX = &uc, and PC (slot 32) is the handler, a function-table
 * index. After the handler, rt_sigreturn restores the interrupted context
 * -- the syscall's result included -- and its PC, so the loop ends when PC
 * is back to what the stub saw. */
