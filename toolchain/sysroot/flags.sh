# Shared by the Wine and sysroot scripts: clang's flags for wasm32 code that runs as
# a gex native module (position-independent, shared memory, one instance per
# thread). Kept to the features V8 and wasmtime 27 both have. No tail calls:
# binaryen's asyncify (fork, wcc) cannot instrument them, and the libc is
# shared by every program.

# setjmp/longjmp lower onto wasm exception handling (V8 has it; wasmtime 27,
# gex's native engine, does not: a module that uses setjmp needs the
# wasmtime upgrade to run natively). clang gives a wasm32-*-linux target no
# wasm exception model by default, so it is asked for (-exception-model=wasm),
# or the lowering emits no catch.
