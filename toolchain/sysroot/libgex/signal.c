/* libgex: running the signal frames gex-kernel's wasm32 personality leaves
 * at a syscall's return ("Signals").
 *
 * musl's wasm32 syscall stub (arch/wasm32/syscall_arch.h) calls this when
 * the context's PC changed across the syscall. The frame is i386's: ESP
 * points at it, EAX is the signal, and an rt frame (SA_SIGINFO) has
 * EDX = &info, ECX = &uc. After the handler, sigreturn restores the
 * interrupted context -- the syscall's result included -- and its PC, so
 * the loop ends when PC is back to what the stub saw.
 *
 * Kept out of musl: the frame layout is gex-kernel's protocol, not the
 * libc's; musl's stub only names this function. */
