"""Generate the guest's GL extension allowlist and command aliases.

The guest used to answer glGetStringi(GL_EXTENSIONS) from a hardcoded list of
three names and never asked the host at all. That predates the Mesa path,
where the host reports well over two hundred, and it made every driver
capability invisible: an application cannot use textureGather it has no way to
detect, so exposing a cap without this is exposing nothing.

Forwarding the host's list wholesale is not safe either. An extension is a
promise about entry points as well as about behaviour, and the guest exports a
fixed set of functions; advertising an extension whose commands are missing
turns a graceful fallback into a null call. So the list is filtered: an
extension is claimable only when every command the registry says it requires
is exported by the guest library itself.

That makes the library its own source of truth -- the allowlist is derived
from `nm` on the linked object, not from a hand-kept table -- and it fails
closed, which is the same rule scripts/gl/gen_gl44_transport.py follows: an
extension the registry does not describe is not claimed.

Most of what that first withheld was not missing behaviour but a missing
spelling. GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object requires glBufferDataARB, which is the
same function as glBufferData -- the registry says so with <alias> -- and the
guest exported only the unsuffixed name. Ten extensions applications routinely
test for, instancing and vertex buffer objects among them, were withheld over
nothing but a suffix. So this also emits those aliases, for exported commands
only, and counts them as exports when deciding what is claimable.
