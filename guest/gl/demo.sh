# Run the gears on the host's GL, from a guest that does not know it is one.
#
#   guest/gl/demo.sh [frames] [output.ppm]
#
# Builds three things and then runs the last of them:
#
#   * the guest's GL driver, libGLESv2.so.2 and libEGL.so.1, which are
#     marshallers rather than an implementation of OpenGL;
#   * a small root filesystem holding them and a musl loader;
#   * gles-gears, an ordinary GLES2 program cross-compiled for aarch64
#     against the standard headers.
#
# Then `gexc run --gl` gives the guest `/dev/gex-gl`, and the drawing happens
# on whatever OpenGL the host has.
#
# Nothing about the program is gex-aware. It includes <EGL/egl.h> and
# <GLES2/gl2.h>, links against the usual sonames, and would run unchanged on
# a phone.
