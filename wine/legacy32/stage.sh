# The PE side of a 32-bit Wine dist, and the bare prefix it is staged through:
#
#   wine32/stage.sh BUILD SRC DIST BAREPFX
#
# stage-native.sh makes BAREPFX: the host's staged x86 Wine prefix
# (GEX_WINE_PREFIX, wine/legacy32/nt-stage-wine.sh), its i386 DLLs rebased to
# wine32-bases.txt, with the core DLLs and WINE32_PROGRAMS replaced by wasm32
# skeletons over one module of Wine's PE side (winepe.wasm). Its syswow64
# becomes system32 (a 32-bit prefix), links into the shared x86 prefix are
# copied (wineboot writes system32), and dosdevices are made.
# DIST/lib/wine/i386-windows gets every DLL from it, DIST/share/wine the data
# wineboot and win32u read (wine.inf, nls, fonts, winmd).
# Env: GEX_WASM_SYSROOT, GEX_WINE_PREFIX.
