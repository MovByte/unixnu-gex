# A 32-bit Wine install and its prefixes, built from a given Wine checkout, as
# wine64-dist.sh is for 64-bit Wine (`make wine32` builds the one wine/wine.pins' WINE_COMMIT names):
#
#   wine/legacy32/wine32-dist.sh WINE CACHE
#
# prints WINE32_DIST=..., WINE32_PREFIX=... (Wayland), WINE32_PREFIX_NULL=... (the null
# driver), WINE32_PREFIX_BARE=... (staged, not installed: for a wineboot of
# one's own), WINE32_KEY=..., WINE32_BUILD=..., WINE32_WINE_SRC=... and
# GEX_WASM_SYSROOT=... (its wasm32 build tree, source and sysroot: a test that
# links a native module of its own) and WINE32_WINE=..., to eval. It is this directory's
# Makefile with WINE_DIR=WINE and WINE32_CACHE=CACHE: every output is cached
# there by the Wine tree and gex's inputs (the sysroot's and libraries'
# pins, these tools, guest/gl), so a rerun on the same commit only checks,
# and the sysroot and libraries are shared with every other 32-bit Wine build in
# CACHE. The prefixes are made by wineboot under GEXC (default this tree's
# target/x86/release/gexc). The PE side is Wine's own DLLs (the host's
# staged x86 Wine prefix, GEX_WINE_PREFIX, with the core DLLs from WINE):
# no Windows binaries.
# Env: GEXC; WINE32_JOBS (default 12); WINE32_STRIP=0 (the PE modules keep their names: -dbg). The log of a build is CACHE/wine32-dist-KEY.log.
