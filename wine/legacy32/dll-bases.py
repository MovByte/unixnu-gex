"""Pinned DLL addresses for a 32-bit Wine bundle: its prefix's dll-bases file, which
Wine's server reads (server/mapping.c, "ADDRESS UNIXPATH" lines) to place
each named image, relocated if need be, at that address.

In the browser a 32-bit Wine process's memory grows only as high as it is used (the
compact space), and gex keeps
[0x11000000, 0x20000000) as an island for these pins. An image left at its
own base (wine32-bases.txt puts the dist's DLLs at 0x20000000-0x7b000000) is
mapped wherever the shim's heap may already sit once the arena's cursor has
passed it: the mapping is refused, and a game that needs the room
runs out. So the DLLs a program loads go in the band, bottom-up
from 0x11000000, each at its size rounded to 64 KiB plus a 64 KiB gap, in
the order given (keep the list's order stable: a function-tier unit is keyed
by its image and its base).

    dll-bases.py assign OUT [--map GUEST=HOST]... < PATHS
    dll-bases.py check FILE

assign: PATHS is one image per line, as the server names it (the unix path
it opened: /wine32/lib/wine/i386-windows/x.dll in the page, the dist's own path
natively). --map says where a path prefix is on this machine, to read the
image's header. Programs, images without relocations (they cannot move) and
paths not found are left out, each said once on stderr; a line already
given is skipped. An image the band has no room left for stays at its own
base too (said on stderr): put the hottest images first.
check: every line of FILE is in the band, granule-aligned and above the line
before it, as assign writes them (exit 1 otherwise).
