# WINE_BUILD is a wasm32 build tree of the Wine fork (winegcc there leaves
# each DLL's relocatable object and export list), WINE_SRC its source. The
# rest of the prefix links to the x86 one (GEX_WINE_PREFIX, default
# ~/.cache/gex/wine-11.15), so the DLLs not named stay i386 code. Its
# layout pins are dropped: they are for the x86 DLLs. GEX_WASM_SYSROOT must
# be set (toolchain/sysroot/build32.sh). Every i386 DLL in syswow64 ends
# at its fixed base from wine32-bases.txt (rebase.py): a 32-bit Wine dist's
# lib/wine/i386-windows takes its DLLs from here, never from the x86 prefix.
